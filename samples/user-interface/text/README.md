# TextSpan samples

This sample demonstrates several text-related features in Android.

### [Text Span](src/main/java/com/example/platform/ui/text/TextSpan.kt)

[`buildSpannedString`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/core/text/package-summary#buildSpannedString(kotlin.Function1))
in the [core-ktx](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx#core) library is useful for quickly
building a rich text.

### [Linkify](src/main/java/com/example/platform/ui/text/Linkify.kt)

[LinkifyCompat](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/text/util/LinkifyCompat)
is useful for creating links in TextViews. The API supports email addresses, phone numbers, and web
URLs out of the box, and you can also use regular expressions to create a custom link pattern.

### [Hyphenation](src/main/java/com/example/platform/ui/text/Hyphenation.kt)

Automatic hyphenation is available for a number of languages including English.

Android 6.0 Marshmallow (API level 23) introduced the
[android:hyphenationFrequency](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TextView#attr_android:hyphenationFrequency)
attribute to apply automatic hyphenation to a `TextView`.

Android 13 (API level 33) introduced 2 new options, `fullFast` and `normalFast`. These are the same
as `full` and `normal`, but use faster algorithm for better performance.
