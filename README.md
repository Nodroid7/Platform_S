# Platform Samples

A collection of samples of different Android OS platform APIs.

> **Note:** the goal of these samples are to showcase certain functionality in isolation and might
> use simplified code. For best practices follow our documentation and check
> [Now In Android](https://github.com/android/nowinandroid)

Browse the samples inside each topic samples folder:

- [Camera](samples/camera)
- [Connectivity](samples/connectivity)
- [Location](samples/location)
- [Privacy](samples/privacy)
- [User-interface](samples/user-interface)

You can find a list of all the available samples [here](samples/README.md).

> **Important:** each sample is isolated from the rest and only contains the specific sample code.
> The wiring into the main application is done under the hood and an implementation detail not
> needed to understand the sample functionality.
