# ConstraintLayout

[`ConstraintLayout`][1] lets you create large, complex layouts with a flat view hierarchyâ€”no nested
view groups. All views are laid out according to relationships between sibling views and the parent
layout. It is easy to use with Android Studio's Layout Editor. For detail, read
[Build a responsive UI with ConstraintLayout][2].
